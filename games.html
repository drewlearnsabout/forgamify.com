            <p>Cognitive science tell us learning takes place at a deeper 
                and more meaningful level the more a student enjoys the process. 
                At Gamify inc., we are bringing the fun back into learning.  
                Some students claim they don't even realize they are studying 
                when they play our games- everyone wins, 
                gone are the days that learning must be a task!</p>

                    a distrust of science, incivility, ethnocentrism, cognitive bias, and social apathy.
