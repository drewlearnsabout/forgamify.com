                <h3>About Founder Kurt Olson</h3>
                <p>Kurt Olson is an instructor at Modesto Junior College 
                    in California. Kurt is a former swim coach who found 
                    that playing games while under strenuous training conditions 
                    allowed for athletes to achieve higher levels of performance 
                    while smiling and having fun. Through research, it turns out 
                    that gamification and play is effective in academia as well, 
                    if not under-utilized.</p>
